# Thump

## Introduction
Thump is a Minecraft IRC bridge that uses the [Warren](https://github.com/voxelcarrot/Warren) library.

It will provide an API for plugins so others can integrate their own functionality relatively easily.

## Building
This mod uses Forge's Gradle wrapper for pretty easy setup and building. There are better guides around the internet for using it, and I don't do anything particularly special.

The general idea:
* **Setup**: `./gradlew [setupDevWorkspace/setupDecompWorkspace] [idea/eclipse]`
* **Building**: `./gradlew build`

If you run in to odd Gradle issues, doing `./gradlew clean` usually fixes it.
